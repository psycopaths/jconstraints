# jConstraints-CVC4
This is the CVC4 binding for jConstraints. Using this jar in combination with the [cvc4-turnkey](https://github.com/tudo-aqua/cvc4-turnkey) artifact allows to run SMT-queries from jConstraints with the CVC4 solver.
The bindings are still work in progress, but expect updates soon.
